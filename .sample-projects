# Project settings
#
# This file is read from .projuxrc to configure project specific settings. Both
# per project environment variables and per project aliases can be configured.
# Entries are grouped per project (e.g. git project directory). The PROJECT_NAME
# environment variable should be first in the list. All vars/aliases after this
# setting and before the next PROJECT_NAME setting will updated whenever the
# 'projux <project>' command is called with a name matching the project name.
# See .projuxrc for information on the special key/value format used with
# project windows, selectable commands, and commands based on file types.
#
# Example:
#
# Basic settings:
#   PROJECT_NAME=foo
#   PROJECT_HOST=mybuild-machine                  # Project specific tmux host
#   PROJECT_WINDOWS="vim::zsh repl::scala"        # Project specific tmux wins
#   PROJECT_DIR=${HOME}/Workspace/${PROJECT_NAME} # Root project dir
#   PROJECT_SRC_DIR=${PROJECT_DIR}/src            # Where to find source
#   PROJECT_TEST_DIR=${PROJECT_DIR}/test          # Where to find tests
#   PROJECT_TARGET_DIR=${PROJECT_DIR}/bazel-out   # Where to find/put output
#   PROJECT_BIN_DIR=${PROJECT_DIR}/bazel-bin/{$PROJECT_NAME} # Where to find exe
#   PROJECT_GEN_DIR=${PROJECT_DIR}/bazel-genfiles # Where to find/put gen source
#   PROJECT_PKGS="com/example1 com/example2"      # Dirs in src/test with files
#   PROJECT_INCLUDE_FILTER=*.{cc,h}:*.scala:*java # Files in pkgs to include
#   PROJECT_EXCLUDE_FILTER="*tmp/*:*backup/*"     # Files/dirs to exclude
#   PROJECT_BUG=555555                            # Bug associated with project
#
# Selectable commands:
#   PROJECT_RUN_CMDS="client::client --flags server::server --port=1234"
#   PROJECT_PACKAGE_CMDS="jar::jar ${PROJECT_TARGET_DIR}/classes"
#   PROJECT_DEPLOY_CMDS="ant deploy"
#   PROJECT_GENDOCS_CMDS="sbt doc"
#   PROJECT_SEARCH_CMDS="my_search"
#
# Commands Based on File Type (typically set via DEFAULT_XXX in .bashrc):
#   PROJECT_FORMAT_CMDS="cc:h::clang-format <targtes> go::gofmt <targets>"
#   PROJECT_LINT_CMDS="go::golint <targets>;govet <targets> py::plint <targets>"
#   PROJECT_BUILD_CMDS="scala::scalac java::javac"
#   PROJECT_TEST_CMDS="scala::sbt test"
#   PROJECT_COVERAGE_CMDS="rb::rake coverage"
#   PROJECT_TEST_SUFFIXES="cc:_test"
#
# Custom Command Implementations (not needed if use PROJECT_XXX_CMDS)
#   PROJECT_FORMAT_FN=my_format
#   PROJECT_LINT_FN=my_lint
#   PROJECT_BUILD_FN=my_build
#   PROJECT_TEST_FN=my_test
#   PROJECT_COVERAGE_FN=my_coverage
#   PROJECT_GETERRORS_FN=my_geterrors
#   PROJECT_GETURL_FN=my_geturl
#   PROJECT_SANITY_FN=my_sanity
#
# Per project backup/sync settings (typically defaulted in .bashrc):
#   PROJECT_SHARE_DIR=~/Public/${PROJECT_NAME}
#   PROJECT_BACKUP_DIR=~/backups/${PROJECT_NAME}
#   PROJECT_SYNC_LIST=~/.projectsync
#   PROJECT_SYNC_DESTs=~
#
# In some cases, if a project variable is not set directly here a default
# value can be assigned from DEFAULT_XXX enviornment vars that can be
# pre-configured in .bashrc. The following vars support defaults:
#
#   DEFAULT_PROJECT_HOST  (built-in default is $(hostname))
#   DEFAULT_PROJECT_WINDOWS  (built-in default is "vim::bash build::bash")
#   DEFAULT_PROJECT_SHARE_DIR (built-in default is "~/Public/<project_name>")
#   DEFAULT_PROJECT_BACKUP_DIR  (built-in default is "~/backups/<project_name>")
#   DEFAULT_PROJECT_SYNC_LIST  (built-in default is "~/projectsync")
#   DEFAULT_PROJECT_SYNC_DESTS  (built-in default is "~")
#   DEFAULT_PROJECT_INCLUDE_FILTER
#   DEFAULT_PROJECT_EXCLUDE_FILTER
#   DEFAULT_PROJECT_FORMAT_CMDS
#   DEFAULT_PROJECT_LINT_CMDS
#   DEFAULT_PROJECT_BUILD_CMDS
#   DEFAULT_PROJECT_TEST_CMDS
#   DEFAULT_PROJECT_TEST_SUFFIXES
#   DEFAULT_PROJECT_COVERAGE_CMDS
#   DEFAULT_PROJECT_RUN_CMDS
#   DEFAULT_PROJECT_PACKAGE_CMDS
#   DEFAULT_PROJECT_DEPLOY_CMDS
#   DEFAULT_PROJECT_GENDOCS_CMDS
#   DEFAULT_PROJECT_SEARCH_CMDS
#   DEFAULT_PROJECT_FORMAT_FN
#   DEFAULT_PROJECT_LINT_FN
#   DEFAULT_PROJECT_BUILD_FN
#   DEFAULT_PROJECT_TEST_FN
#   DEFAULT_PROJECT_COVERAGE_FN
#   DEFAULT_PROJECT_GETERRORS_FN
#   DEFAULT_PROJECT_GETURL_FN
#   DEFAULT_PROJECT_SANITY_FN
#
# Normally all the XX_FN variables will be set once in .bashrc via the
# DEFAULT version to customize all settings to given build environment.
# See .sample-bashrc for examples.
