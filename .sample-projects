# Project settings
#
# This file is read from .projectrc to configure project specific settings. Both
# per project environment variables and per project aliases can be configured.
# Entries are grouped per project (e.g. git project directory). The PROJECT_NAME
# environment variable should be first in the list. All vars/aliases after this
# setting and before the next PROJECT_NAME setting will updated whenever the
# 'project' command is called with a name matching the project name.
#
# Example:
#   PROJECT_NAME=foo
#   PROJECT_TYPE=scala
#   PROJECT_HOST=mybuild-machine
#   PROJECT_WINDOWS="vim,bash,repl"
#   PROJECT_BUG=555555
#   PROJECT_DIR=${HOME}/Workspace/${PROJECT_NAME}
#   PROJECT_PKGS="com/example1 com/example2"
#   PROJECT_SRC_DIR=${PROJECT_DIR}/src
#   PROJECT_TEST_DIR=${PROJECT_DIR}/test
#   PROJECT_BUILD_DIR=${PROJECT_DIR}           # Used for both lint/build
#   PROJECT_BIN_DIR=${PROJECT_DIR}/target/bin  # Contains built executable
#   PROJECT_GEN_DIR=${PROJECT_DIR}/target/gen  # Contains generated code
#   PROJECT_DEFAULT_FORMAT_TARGETS="${PROJECT_SRC_DIR}/com/example1/*.scala"
#   PROJECT_DEFAULT_LINT_TARGETS="..."
#   PROJECT_DEFAULT_BUILD_TARGETS=":all"
#   PROJECT_DEFAULT_TEST_TARGETS="FooTest BarTest"
#   PROJECT_TARGETS_IGNORE="/tmp"
#   PROJECT_DEFAULT_RUN_CMDS="client::client --flags server::server --port=1234"
#   PROJECT_SHARE_DIR=~/Public/${PROJECT_NAME}
#   PROJECT_BACKUP_DIR=~/backups/${PROJECT_NAME}
#   PROJECT_SYNC_LIST=~/.projectsync
#   PROJECT_SYNC_DESTs=~
#   PROJECT_SEARCH_FN=my_search
#   PROJECT_LINT_FN=my_lint
#   PROJECT_FORMAT_FN=my_format
#   PROJECT_BUILD_FN=my_build
#   PROJECT_TEST_FN=my_test
#   PROJECT_COVERAGE_FN=my_coverage
#   PROJECT_GETERRORS_FN=my_geterrors
#   PROJECT_GETURL_FN=my_geturl
#   PROJECT_SANITY_FN=my_sanity
#   alias deploy='my_deploy_script'
#   alias undeploy='my_undeploy_script'
#
# The characters '...' mean apply a target recursively to the given directory.
#
# NOTE: For PROJECT_DEFAULT_RUN_CMDS multiple executables can be tagged with
#   label:: to distinguish them. The label is then provided to the run
#   command to select the appropriate program. If no label is provided then
#   the first entry is used.
#
#   For example:
#     PROJECT_DEFAULT_RUN_CMDS="foo::xxx --flags bar::yyy --flags bat:zzz"
#     $ run foo       # runs xxx --flags
#     $ run bar       # runs yyy --flags
#     $ run           # runs xxx --flags
#
# In some cases, if a project variable is not set directly here a default
# value can be assigned from DEFAULT_XXX enviornment vars that can be
# pre-configured in .bashrc. The following vars support defaults:
#
#   DEFAULT_PROJECT_HOST  (built-in default is $(hostname))
#   DEFAULT_PROJECT_WINDOWS  (built-in default is "vim,bash")
#   DEFAULT_PROJECT_TARGETS_IGNORE  (built-in default is "/tmp,/backup")
#   DEFAULT_PROJECT_SHARE_DIR (built-in default is "~/Public/<project_name>")
#   DEFAULT_PROJECT_BACKUP_DIR  (built-in default is "~/backups/<project_name>")
#   DEFAULT_PROJECT_SYNC_LIST  (built-in default is "~/projectsync")
#   DEFAULT_PROJECT_SYNC_DESTS  (built-in default is "~")
#   DEFAULT_PROJECT_SEARCH_FN
#   DEFAULT_PROJECT_LINT_FN
#   DEFAULT_PROJECT_FORMAT_FN
#   DEFAULT_PROJECT_BUILD_FN
#   DEFAULT_PROJECT_TEST_FN
#   DEFAULT_PROJECT_COVERAGE_FN
#   DEFAULT_PROJECT_GETERRORS_FN
#   DEFAULT_PROJECT_GETURL_FN
#   DEFAULT_PROJECT_SANITY_FN
#
# Normally all the XX_FN variables will be set once in .bashrc via the
# DEFAULT version to customize all settings to given build environment.
